# VocalThread: Enhancing YouTube Comment Analysis with Voice

## Project Overview
VocalThread builds upon the foundation of [CommentScope](https://comment-scope.streamlit.app/), adding an auditory dimension to YouTube comment analysis. By integrating ElevenLabs' text-to-speech technology, we aim to transform written comments into engaging audio dialogues.

## Key Features

1. **ElevenLabs Integration**
   - Utilize ElevenLabs' text-to-speech API for high-quality voice synthesis
   - Implement voice customization options for different comment types

2. **Comment-to-Speech Conversion**
   - Convert text comments into spoken audio
   - Maintain the context and emotion of the original text

3. **Unique Voices for Comments**
   - Assign distinct voices to different commenters for a more immersive experience
   - Implement voice variety based on comment sentiment or user characteristics

4. **Audio Summarization**
   - Convert the text summary generated by CommentScope into spoken format
   - Create an audio overview of the comment section

5. **Interactive Audio Playback**
   - Develop a user interface for navigating through audio comments
   - Include options for playback speed, skipping, and filtering

## Technical Considerations
- Integrate ElevenLabs API with existing CommentScope infrastructure
- Optimize audio generation and playback for performance
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve user experience

## Potential Challenges
- Managing API usage and costs
- Ensuring accurate emotion and context translation from text to speech
- Handling multilingual comments and accents

## Next Steps
1. Set up ElevenLabs API integration
2. Develop a prototype for converting a single comment to speech
3. Expand functionality to handle multiple comments and threading
4. Implement the audio summarization feature
5. Design and develop the interactive audio playback interface

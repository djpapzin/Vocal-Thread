* **Time Management:** Each phase has a tighter timeline, requiring efficient collaboration and focused effort.

**Communication:**

* Continue daily stand-up meetings to track progress and address blockers.
* Utilize Discord for quick communication and updates.

**Notes:**

* This revised roadmap is crucial for meeting the 5-day deadline.
* Team members must adhere to the timeline and communicate any issues immediately.
* Focus on delivering a polished and functional core product that demonstrates the potential of VocalThread.

By adapting to the shortened timeframe and prioritizing essential features, we can still create a compelling and impactful VocalThread demonstration within the 5-day deadline.
